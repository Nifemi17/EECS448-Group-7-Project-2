For this project, I decided to use function point analysis to estimate the amount of hours needed
to complete the project, based on the lecture slides for EECS 448.

I started with calculating the function points for project 1. Then I divided project 1's total work 
hours by its function points to find that our group has a rate of 2.41 work hours per function point.
After that, I calculated the function points for our custom additions with the following value assignments:

UFP 
  -inputs
    -click and drag for ship placement: 3 (complexity)
    -special ability activation: 3
    -click and drag for sonar placement: 3
	-AI difficulty selection: 3
	
  -outputs
    -background images: 3
	-ship, hit/miss, sonar images: 3
	-sonar reveal: 3
	-background music, sounds: 3
	
  -I omitted inquiries, master files, and interfaces as there weren't any large, internal or external databases 
  that needed to be communicated with.
	
  -UFP total = 25
  
DI
  -technical factors (that aren't 0)
    -end-user efficiency: 2
	-ease of operation: 2
	
  -DI total = 4
  
TCF = .65 + .01(4) = .69

FP = 25 * .69 = 17.25

Work Hours = 17.25 * 2.41 = 41.57 hours

I estimate that project 2 will take approximately 41.57 work hours to complete.
