For project 1, we think that team 7 used either top down functional decomposition 
design or object oriented design. Team 7 used JavaScript and HTML to code their 
project, which is one reason why we assumed that they may have used top down 
functional decomposition. From looking at their code, it seemed that at the 
beginning they had a big picture idea of how they wanted to go about the project. 
As the code progresses, they worked their way through different methods that they 
needed throughout the project and implemented the methods by breaking them down 
into smaller components that were easier to implement than a big component would be. 
However, they did not do the best job of making the components super small, as many 
functions that could have been broken down into smaller parts were not actually broken 
down, but rather left as long functions. This is why we were between top down functional 
decomposition and object oriented design when deciding which paradigm that they used. 
Even though JavaScript is not specifically known as an object oriented programming 
language, team 7 used it as though it is that kind of language. They had some components 
defined as objects, for example the boards and ships. They also assigned methods to these 
objects and classes for manipulating the data of the game. This was not the easiest for 
us to interpret, as none of us had ever used classes in JavaScript before. The code we 
received was a little bit unorganized, so trying to figure out the design paradigm that they 
used was not super clear and a little difficult to do.
