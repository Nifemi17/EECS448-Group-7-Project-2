Implementation Ideas:


---AI---
-Let user choose AI or human player (buttons)

-Let user choose difficulty (buttons)

-3 difficulties
  -Easy: random number generator to pick shots
  -Medium: random number generator until ship is found, search orthogonally until ship sinks, reset
  -Hard: all shots hit a ship until all ships sink

-Choose a valid shot per turn

-Add player selection screen and difficulty selection screen (if AI selected) before asking number of ships


---Animation---
-Distinction between AI and human board

-Place images of ships instead of symbols (reveal when sunk), explosion image instead of hit

-Scoreboard indicating number of ships left, wins
  -make an object for each unique player to track number of turns
  
-Click and drag ship images to place them
  

---Gameplay---
-Points awarded for hit/sink
  -Extra points based on difficulty
 
-Points spent on abilities


---AI Class Functions---
-function for player to select ai or player, and difficulty

-function for random placement

-(the next three functions will be determined in main.js)
function for random shots

-function to shot orthogonally

-function for Hard shots
